# ‚è≥ My Journey

From an early age, one of my cousins, who was always passionate about video games, inspired me to explore this fascinating world. I began by playing Club Penguin and later moved on to gaming on the DS, especially enjoying Pok√©mon, before diving into Minecraft. It was in Minecraft that my journey truly began. I spent a lot of time playing on community servers, particularly those run by YouTubers I followed, which eventually motivated me to create my own server. To achieve this, I started learning Java and developed my server using this language.

As I entered my late teens, I ventured into creating a GTA RP server (FiveM), a popular trend at the time and a game I had played extensively. After graduating from high school, I enrolled in the Computer Science program at Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie. There, I gained substantial experience with Python, C, and C++. Utilizing these technologies, I worked on several interesting projects, such as the ["Grafo de Com√©rcio Exterior"](https://github.com/arturstaation/GrafoComercioExterior), a [project developed for a hackathon](https://github.com/LorenzoPercussi/Desafio-Hackathon-Hiperstream) and [EchoTrashers](https://github.com/arturstaation/EcoTrashers), a recycling-themed game,created with Java.

I would like to dedicate a special mention to the recycling game. An article about this project was submitted to the X-JIHCI2024 (X Jornadas Iberoamericanas de Interacci√≥n Humano-Computadora JIHCI2024) international conference. Not only was the article accepted, but it was also recognized as one of the best papers at the conference and invited for publication in a journal.

# üíº Experience

My first professional experience was with Siemens Healthineers, a branch of the global Siemens corporation focused on healthcare. Although my internship was not directly related to programming, I gained valuable insights during my two years there. I learned extensively about computer networks, Excel, network infrastructure, Linux, and Windows Server, as well as developed key skills in maturity and responsibility. Throughout my time at the company, I read numerous documentation and sought help from colleagues until I could independently handle procedures. Over time, I started collaborating with international teams from Germany and Mexico to resolve issues and provide support.

After leaving Siemens, I secured an interview opportunity with Hiperstream through a hackathon. Hiperstream is where I began my career as a developer. Upon joining the company, I spent my first two months taking courses on the technologies used by the company. These courses provided me with substantial knowledge in .NET, particularly C#, and in frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Vue. Additionally, I delved into the company's infrastructure, gaining expertise in Google Cloud Platform and its resources, such as Kubernetes, Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, and BigQuery.
